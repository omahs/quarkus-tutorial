== Why Quarkus?

Historically Java was able to handle the biggest enterprise problem(s) with its "Write once, run anywhere" (WORA) paradigm. With Cloud Native Applications growing in popularity, things like running applications as linux containers, serverless taking center stage -- Java was pushed back by languages like golang, node.js as the forerunner to build Cloud Native Applications as they are smaller, quicker and arguably more nimble.

Quarkus is Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.

In this tutorial we will start to explore how to create, build and deploy Cloud Native Java applications using Quarkus. The Java applications built this way are tiny as a subatomic particle (Quark) and tend to boot and run at supersonic speed

## Building the HTML locally

In the root of your git repository, run (as root):

```
# bin/build-site.sh
```

And then open your `gh-pages/index.html` file:

```
open gh-pages/index.html
```

## Iterative local development

You can develop the tutorial docs locally using a rapid iterative cycle.

First, install the `yarn` dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
$ yarn install
----

And now start `gulp` (as root). It will create the website and open your browser connected with `browser-sync`. Every time it detects a change, it will automatically refresh your browser page.

[source,bash]
----
# gulp
----

You can clean the local cache using:

[source,bash]
----
gulp clean
----
